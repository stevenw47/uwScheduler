# uwScheduler

uwScheduler allows UW students to easily schedule their courses for a given term by inputting courses they are interested in, and then visually seeing all the course offerings.
It uses the [UWaterloo Open Data API](https://uwaterloo.ca/api/) to fetch information about courses.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you can run

```
docker-compose up
```

to start the client and api.

## TODO

- Automatic schedule finding
- Interactive calendar
- Better (human-readable) term selection
- Create sample .env files
- Extend calendar to 9:30pm
- ...
